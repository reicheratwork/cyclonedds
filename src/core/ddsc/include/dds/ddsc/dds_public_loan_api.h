/**
 * @brief Return loaned samples to a reader or writer
 * @ingroup loan
 * @component read_data
 *
 * Used to release sample buffers returned by a read/take operation (a reader-loan)
 * or, in case shared memory is enabled, of the loan_sample operation (a writer-loan).
 *
 * When the application provides an empty buffer to a reader-loan, memory is allocated and
 * managed by DDS. By calling dds_return_loan(), the reader-loan is released so that the buffer
 * can be reused during a successive read/take operation. When a condition is provided, the
 * reader to which the condition belongs is looked up.
 *
 * Writer-loans are normally released implicitly when writing a loaned sample, but you can
 * cancel a writer-loan prematurely by invoking the return_loan() operation. For writer loans, buf is
 * overwritten with null pointers for all successfully returned entries. Any failure causes it to abort,
 * possibly midway through buf.
 *
 * @param[in] entity The entity that the loan belongs to.
 * @param[in,out] buf An array of (pointers to) samples, some or all of which will be set to null pointers.
 * @param[in] bufsz The number of (pointers to) samples stored in buf.
 *
 * @returns A dds_return_t indicating success or failure
 * @retval DDS_RETCODE_OK
 *             - the operation was successful; for a writer loan, all entries in buf are set to null
 *             - this specifically includes cases where bufsz <= 0 while entity is valid
 * @retval DDS_RETCODE_BAD_PARAMETER
 *             - the entity parameter is not a valid parameter
 *             - buf is null, or bufsz > 0 and buf[0] = null
 *             - (for writer loans) buf[0 <= i < bufsz] is null; operation is aborted, all buf[j < i] = null on return
 * @retval DDS_RETCODE_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET
 *             - (for reader loans) buf was already returned (not guaranteed to be detected)
 *             - (for writer loans) buf[0 <= i < bufsz] does not correspond to an outstanding loan, all buf[j < i] = null on return
 * @retval DDS_RETCODE_UNSUPPORTED
 *             - (for writer loans) invoked on a writer not supporting loans.
 * @retval DDS_RETCODE_ILLEGAL_OPERATION
 *             - the operation is invoked on an inappropriate object.
